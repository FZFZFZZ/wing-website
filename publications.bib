abstract = {Web information is increasingly used as evidence in solving various problems, including record matching. However, acquiring web-based resources is slow and can incur other access costs. As such, solutions often acquire only a subset of the resources to achieve a balance between acquisition cost and benefit. Unfortunately, existing work has largely ignored the issue of which resources to acquire. They also fail to emphasize on the hierarchical nature of resource acquisitions, e.g., the search engine results for two queries must be obtained before their TF-IDF cosine similarity be computed. In this paper, we propose a framework for performing cost-sensitive acquisition of resources with hierarchical dependencies, and apply it to the web resource context. Our framework is versatile, and we show that a large variety of problems can be formulated using resource dependency graphs. We solve the resource acquisition problem by casting it as a combinatorial search problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our acquisition framework on record matching problems of different domains.},

abstract = {We investigate the automatic harvesting of research paper metadata from recent scholarly events. Our system, Kairos, combines a focused crawler and an information extraction engine, to convert a list of conference websites into a index filled with fields of metadata that correspond to individual papers. Using event date metadata extracted from the conference website, Kairos proactively harvests metadata about the individual papers soon after they are made public. We use a Maximum Entropy classifier to classify uniform resource locators (URLs) as scientific conference websites and use Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to extract individual paper metadata from such websites. Experiments show an acceptable measure of classification accuracy of over 95\% for each of the two components.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm to measure domain-specific readability. It iteratively computes the readability of domain-specific resources based on the difficulty of domain-specific concepts and vice versa, in a style reminiscent of other bipartite graph algorithms such as Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) and the Stochastic Approach for Link-Structure Analysis (SALSA). While simple, our algorithm outperforms standard heuristic measures and remains competitive among supervised-learning approaches. Moreover, it is less domain-dependent and portable across domains as it does not rely on an annotated corpus or expensive expert knowledge that supervised or domain-specific methods require.},

In our preliminary evaluation, we presented our FireCite prototype to four academics in separate unstructured interviews. Their positive feedback gives evidence to the desirability of FireCite's citation management capabilities.},

abstract = {We present an automated approach to classify sentences of scholarly work with respect to their rhetorical function. While previous work that achieves this task of argumentative zoning requires richly annotated input, our approach is robust to noise and can process raw text. Even in cases where the input has noise (as it is obtained from optical character recognition or text extraction from PDF files), our robust classifier is largely accurate. We perform an in-depth study of our system both with clean and noisy inputs. We also give preliminary results from in situ acceptability testing when the classifier is embedded within a digital library reading environment.},
