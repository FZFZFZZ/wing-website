abstract = {We introduce a general, interest-aware topic model (IATM), in which known higher-level interests on topics expressed by each user can be modeled. We then specialize the IATM for use in consumer health forum thread recommendation by equating each user's self-reported medical conditions as interests and topics as symptoms of treatments for recommendation. The IATM additionally models the implicit interests embodied by users' textual descriptions in their profiles. To further enhance the personalized nature of the recommendations, we introduce jointly normalized collaborative topic regression (JNCTR) which captures how users interact with the various symptoms belonging to the same clinical condition. In our experiments on two real-world consumer health forums, our proposed model significantly outperforms competitive state-of-the-art baselines by over 10\% in recall. Importantly, we show that our IATM+JNCTR pipeline also imbues the recommendation process with added transparency, allowing a recommendation system to justify its recommendation with respect to each user's interest in certain health conditions.},

abstract = {Capturing the semantic interaction of pairs of words across arguments and proper argument representation are both crucial issues in implicit discourse relation recognition. The current state-of-the-art represents arguments as distributional vectors that are computed via bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTMs), known to have significant model complexity.In contrast, we demonstrate that word-weighted averaging can encode argument representation which can be incorporated with word pair information efficiently. By saving an order of magnitude in parameters and eschewing the recurrent structure, our proposed model achieves equivalent performance, but trains seven times faster.},

abstract = {Big Science and cross-disciplinary collaborations have reshaped the intellectual structure of research areas. A number of works have tried to uncover this hidden intellectual structure by analyzing citation contexts. However, none of them analyzed by document logical structures such as sections. The two major goals of this study are to find characteristics of authors who are highly cited section-wise and to identify the differences in section-wise author networks. This study uses 29,158 of research articles culled from the ACL Anthology, which hosts articles on computational linguistics and natural language processing. We find that the distribution of citations across sections is skewed and that a different set of highly cited authors share distinct academic characteristics, according to their citation locations. Furthermore, the author networks based on citation context similarity reveal that the intellectual structure of a domain differs across different sections.},

title = {Using discourse signals for robust instructor intervention prediction},
year = {2017},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {We tackle the prediction of instructor intervention in student posts from discussion forums in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Our key finding is that using automatically obtained discourse relations improves the prediction of when instructors intervene in student discussions, when compared with a state-of-the-art, feature-rich baseline. Our supervised classifier makes use of an automatic discourse parser which outputs Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) tags that represent in-post discourse features. We show PDTB relation-based features increase the robustness of the classifier and complement baseline features in recalling more diverse instructor intervention patterns. In comprehensive experiments over 14 MOOC offerings from several disciplines, the PDTB discourse features improve performance on average. The resultant models are less dependent on domain-specific vocabulary, allowing them to better generalize to new courses.},

In this paper, we develop a hybrid app recommender framework that integrates a variety of app-related features and recommendation techniques, and then identify the most important indicators for the app recommendation task. Our results reveal an interesting correlation with data from third-party app analytics companies; and suggest that, in the context of mobile app recommendation, more focus could be placed in user and trend analysis via social networks.},

abstract = {Many organizations possess social media accounts on different social networks, but these profiles are not always linked. End applications, users, as well as the organization themselves, can benefit when the profiles are appropriately identified and linked. Most existing works on social network entity linking focus on linking individuals, and do not model features specific for organizational linking. We address this gap not only to link official social media accounts but also to discover and solve the identification and linking of associated affiliate accounts -- such as geographical divisions and brands -- which are important to distinguish.We instantiate our method for classifying profiles on social network services for Twitter and Facebook, which major organizations use. We classify profiles as to whether they belong to an organization or its affiliates. Our best classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.976 on average in both datasets, significantly improving baselines that exploit the features used in state-of-the-art comparable user linkage strategies.},

We also examine cross-sharing (i.e., the act of user broadcasting their activity to multiple OSNs near-simultaneously), a previously-unstudied behaviour and demonstrate how certain OSNs play the roles of originating source and destination sinks.},

abstract = {To help generate relevant suggestions for researchers, recommendation systems have started to leverage the latent interests in the publication profiles of the researchers themselves. While using such a publication citation network has been shown to enhance performance, the network is often sparse, making recommendation difficult. To alleviate this sparsity, in our former work, we identified "potential citation papers" through the use of collaborative filtering. Also, as different logical sections of a paper have different significance, as a secondary contribution, we investigated which sections of papers can be leveraged to represent papers effectively. While this initial approach works well for researchers vested in a single discipline, it generates poor predictions for scientists who work on several different topics in the discipline (hereafter, "intra-disciplinary"). We thus extend our previous work in this paper by proposing an adaptive neighbor selection method to overcome this problem in our imputation-based collaborative filtering framework. On a publicly-available scholarly paper recommendation dataset, we show that recommendation accuracy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines as measured by nDCG and MRR, when using our adaptive neighbor selection method. While recommendation performance is enhanced for all researchers, improvements are more marked for intra-disciplinary researchers, showing that our method does address the targeted audience.},

abstract = {Image tweets are becoming a prevalent form of social media, but little is known about their content - textual and visual - and the relationship between the two mediums. Our analysis of image tweets shows that while visual elements certainly play a large role in image-text relationships, other factors such as emotional elements, also factor into the relationship. We develop Visual-Emotional LDA (VELDA), a novel topic model to capture the image-text correlation from multiple perspectives (namely, visual and emotional).Experiments on real-world image tweets in both English and Chinese and other user generated content, show that VELDA significantly outperforms existing methods on cross-modality image retrieval. Even in other domains where emotion does not factor in image choice directly, our VELDA model demonstrates good generalization ability, achieving higher fidelity modeling of such multimedia documents.},
